changing masktheface code to create binary masks of the mask
# example command
    python mask_the_face.py --path 'data/celeba_hq_256/10k' --mask_type 'surgical' --verbose 

recreated dataset to include binary mask
preformed postprocessing to convert any grey or non 255 pixels to 255, as it causes issues with outline creates--4 april
Epoch: 29, MAE: 0.0019164204527305734, bestMAE: 0.001909936344395926, bestEpoch: 25.

mistake made, trained at incorrect resolution. may have to retrain the model. 352 upsampled?
pipeline for masked image is created, however it will need to be converted to 255 or 0, rather than greyscale
